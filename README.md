# automotive_on-board_computer

This is a code created from scratch with my friend [Matheus Braum](https://github.com/ThBraum).

The system we created consists of:
- Turn a vehicle on and off.
- Stop the vehicle.
- Calculate speed.
- Calculate distance covered.
- Calculate fuel consumption.
- Show battery voltage.
- Show engine rotations per minute.
- Show date.
- Show the status of the vehicle's components.
- And exit option
